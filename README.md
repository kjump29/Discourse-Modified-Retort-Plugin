# Retort - A Reaction Plugin for Discourse

This is a modification of the Retort plugin for Discourse to work as like/dislike-feature and display all users who liked/disliked a post instead of limiting it to the first two reactions.

### Installation
- Edit your web template and add the project clone url. (https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157)
- Rebuild your web container so that the plugin installs.

You're done!
